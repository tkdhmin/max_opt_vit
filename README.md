# MaxOptVit
This repo is recapitulating CUDA usage with the help of the gtest and providing the optimized Transformer-based super-resolution model such a MaxVit, etc.

###### These two orthogonal project will be split when the project grows.

## Prerequsite
* GPU and CUDA Toolkit: Check whether your GPU driver has been identified using `nvidia-smi` instruction. You may find way to install the GPU driver suitable to your environment.
* clang-format: `sudo apt-get install clang-format` is required to format the source code written in C++ and CUDA. And create `.clang-format` file to define the rule of formatting.
* googletest: Please refer to the `tutorial/hello_cuda_with_gtest/README.md`.
